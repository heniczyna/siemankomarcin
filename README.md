# Overview
Inspired by https://heypiotr.io/
* stylesheet developed using [SCSS syntax](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax)
* color and content adjustments
* added some responsiveness with
```scss
@media only screen and (max-width: 1000px){}
```

# Notes
* `Live Sass Compiler 3.0.0 extension for Visual Studio Code` has been used for compiling/creating `style.css` (make changes in `style.Scss` and extension automatically compiles it to `style.css`)
* `Live Server 5.7.4 extension` for creating local server to fast and easy monitoring changes of the website
* Icons downloaded from https://www.flaticon.com/
  * background's color changed from black to white in [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/)
